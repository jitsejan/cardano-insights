# Cardano Insights - Project Summary

## Overview

**Cardano Insights** is a modern data analytics platform for the Cardano ecosystem, specifically focused on Catalyst funding data and wallet ecosystem intelligence. The project follows modern data engineering patterns with a clear separation between raw data ingestion (dlt) and analytics transformation (dbt).

## Architecture

### Data Stack
- **Ingestion**: dlt (data load tool) for raw API extraction
- **Transformation**: dbt for analytics and enrichment
- **Database**: DuckDB for local analytics
- **Testing**: pytest with comprehensive parametrized testing

### Layer Architecture
```
Bronze Layer (Raw Staging)
â”œâ”€â”€ stg_funds.sql - Catalyst funding rounds
â””â”€â”€ stg_proposals.sql - Raw proposal data

Silver Layer (Enrichment)
â””â”€â”€ proposals_enriched.sql - Wallet detection, funding analysis, GitHub parsing

Gold Layer (Analytics Marts)
â”œâ”€â”€ funded_projects_summary.sql - Funding analytics by fund
â”œâ”€â”€ wallet_ecosystem_analysis.sql - Wallet project analysis
â””â”€â”€ lace_competitive_landscape.sql - Strategic competitive intelligence
```

## Key Features

### 1. **Catalyst Funding Analytics**
- Complete funding data from Lido Nation Catalyst Explorer API
- 12+ Catalyst funds (F1-F13+) with 10,000+ proposals
- Funding success rates, approval metrics, GitHub adoption tracking

### 2. **Wallet Ecosystem Intelligence**
- **Wallet Detection**: Automatically identifies wallet-related projects
- **Competition Analysis**: Categorizes Lace competitors by threat level
- **Strategic Scoring**: Prioritizes projects for competitive monitoring

#### Competition Categories:

- `existing_competitor` - Established wallets (Yoroi, Eternl, Nami, Flint)
- `indirect_competitor` - Mobile/desktop wallets  
- `ecosystem_enabler` - Wallet infrastructure & tooling

### 3. **Analytics & Reporting**
- Funding trends across Catalyst rounds
- Success pattern analysis (funding vs GitHub activity)
- Competitive landscape monitoring
- Ecosystem health metrics

## Development Workflow

### Data Pipeline Commands
```bash
# Data Extraction
make extract-lido        # Sample extraction (2 pages)
make extract-lido-full   # Full extraction (~10k proposals)

# Analytics Pipeline  
make dbt-run            # Run dbt models (bronze â†’ silver â†’ gold)
make analytics-full     # Full pipeline: extract + transform

# Documentation
make dbt-docs           # Generate and serve dbt documentation
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
make test               # Fast unit tests (~0.29s)
make test-integration   # API integration tests
make test-all           # All tests including slow ones
```

## Key Analytics Tables

### 1. `funded_projects_summary`
- Funding metrics by Catalyst fund
- GitHub adoption rates
- Wallet ecosystem project counts
- Success rate analysis

### 2. `wallet_ecosystem_analysis`  
- Detailed wallet project breakdown
- Competition level classification
- Funding success by wallet type
- GitHub repository tracking

### 3. `lace_competitive_landscape`
- Strategic competitive analysis for Lace wallet
- Priority scoring for monitoring
- Funding success rates by competition level

## Technical Highlights

### 1. **Modern Data Engineering Patterns**
- Clean separation: dlt (ingestion) + dbt (transformation)
- Bronze/Silver/Gold medallion architecture
- Comprehensive testing with pytest parametrization
- Professional development workflow with Makefile

### 2. **Simplified Connector Architecture**
```python
# Clean, focused connector
@dlt.resource(name="funds", primary_key="id")
def funds() -> Iterator[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Raw Catalyst funds data"""

@dlt.resource(name="proposals", primary_key="id") 
def proposals(fund_id: Optional[int] = None, max_pages: Optional[int] = None):
    """Raw proposal data - enrichment handled by dbt"""
```

- **Testing**: Built-in data quality testing
- **Lineage**: Automatic data lineage tracking
- **Collaboration**: Easy to review and modify analytics logic

### 2. **Why DuckDB over PostgreSQL?**
- **Local development**: No database setup required
- **Performance**: Excellent analytical performance
- **Portability**: Database file can be easily shared
- **Analytics focus**: Optimized for OLAP workloads

### 3. **Why Simplified Connector Architecture?**
- **Separation of concerns**: dlt for ingestion, dbt for logic
- **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and modify
- **Scalability**: Can easily add new connectors (GitHub, etc.)
- **Testing**: Unit tests for ingestion, dbt tests for analytics
